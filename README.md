# Portfolio

### Hello there!

Welcome to me portfolio page.

The tech is fairly simple, i have only used html/css. I felt taht using a js framework would be a touch of overkill for what i wanted to achive. I have used the flexbox display for my layout.
This did take a little bit of getting used to and some parts did seem counter intuitive at first but i got there in the end.

There is a hero page, a nav bar and 3 main sections.

The colour scheme is based around light blue.

There are links to GitHub repos and some of my social media pages.

Is it responsive i hear you ask? almostâ€¦..

Update. We are responsve!
